🏧 ATM Transaction Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)
This repository showcases a Power BI dashboard project focused on ATM transaction data analytics. The dashboard provides insightful visualizations to understand transaction trends, machine performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency.

📌 Project Overview
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze ATM transaction metrics including withdrawal counts, transaction amounts, failure rates, and machine usage patterns.

Cleaned and transformed raw ATM data using Power Query, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.

Created advanced DAX measures to calculate:

Total Transactions & Withdrawals

Success vs. Failure Rates

Daily and Monthly Trends

Location-wise and ATM-wise Performance

Enabled decision-makers to monitor transaction load, detect high-failure ATMs, and optimize machine deployment.

📈 Key Features
KPI Cards: Show total transactions, success rate, and average transaction value.

Bar & Line Charts: Visualize transaction trends over time.

Map Visuals (if applicable): Display location-based ATM performance.

Slicers: Filter by ATM ID, city, date, and transaction status.

Failure Insights: Identify frequent error types and peak failure times.

🛠️ Tools Used
